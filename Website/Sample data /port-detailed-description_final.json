Commissioned in 1989, it was developed to decongest Mumbai Port and has grown into the largest container-handling major port in the country, handling close to half of US’s containerised traffic. The port has multiple container terminals operated under PPP models, deep-draft berths capable of handling large mainline vessels, and extensive rail and road connections to the industrial and consumption hubs of western, central and northern US. JNPT is closely integrated with the Dedicated Freight Corridor and various inland container depots, making it a key node for export-oriented manufacturing, automotive hubs, and logistics parks. Continuous upgrades in automation, gate systems and digital documentation have positioned JNPT as a modern, efficiency-driven port in US’s maritime network."
